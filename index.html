    <p>Hello World</p>
    <p>This is really cool, I am buliding my first web page.</p> 

 <h1>Fight Club Quotes</h1>
   <p>With my tongue, I can feel the
    rifling in the barrel.  For a second,
    I totally forgot about Tyler's whole
    controlled demolition thing and I
    wondered how clean this gun is.</p>
    
    <p><strong>We are consumers. We're the by-products of a lifestyle obsession.
    </strong>The things you own end up owning you.<em> <strong>It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.
    </strong></em>
  </p>
  <p>The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club. 
      <strong>The second rule of Fight Club is: <em>You do not talk about Fight Club.</em></strong> 
      Third rule of Fight Club: someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out, the fight is over. 
      Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight. 
      Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas. 
      Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes. 
      Seventh rule: fights will go on as long as they have to. 
      And the eighth and final rule: <em>if this is your first night at Fight Club, you have to fight.</em>
